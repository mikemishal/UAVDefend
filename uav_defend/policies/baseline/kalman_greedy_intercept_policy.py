Kalman Greedy Intercept Policy - Kalman-Enhanced Hand-Designed Baseline

This policy is a hand-designed baseline that combines Kalman-filtered state
estimation with simple greedy pursuit. It is designed to run alongside the
environment's Kalman tracker (use_kalman_tracking=True) and consumes the
filtered enemy position estimate (e_hat) provided in the info dictionary.

Purpose:
    This baseline isolates the effect of state estimation without reinforcement
    learning. By comparing this policy against:
      - GreedyInterceptPolicy  (greedy on true state, no estimation)
      - PPO Direct RL          (learned policy on true state)
      - PPO RL-Kalman          (learned policy on Kalman state)
    we can independently measure the value of Kalman filtering and the value
    of learned control, separated from each other.

Strategy:
    1. If a Kalman-estimated enemy position (e_hat) is available in info:
       pursue e_hat directly (greedy pursuit of filtered estimate).
    2. If no estimate is available (enemy not yet detected):
       escort the soldier (defensive positioning until detection occurs).

Design Decision — Stateless:
    This policy maintains no internal state. All estimation is delegated to
    the environment's EnemyKalmanFilter. This makes the policy straightforward
    to evaluate and removes tracking as a per-policy variable.

Usage:
    This policy must be used with an environment configured for Kalman tracking:
        env = SoldierEnv(EnvConfig(use_kalman_tracking=True))
    Using it with use_kalman_tracking=False will result in it receiving true
    enemy positions in e_hat (equivalent to GreedyInterceptPolicy behavior).

class KalmanGreedyInterceptPolicy:
    """
    Kalman-enhanced greedy baseline policy for UAV defense.

    A stateless, hand-designed controller that applies simple greedy pursuit
    to the Kalman-filtered enemy state estimate provided by the environment.
    This is the fourth comparison method in the research, alongside:

        - GreedyInterceptPolicy  : greedy pursuit with true enemy state
        - PPO Direct RL          : learned policy with true enemy state
        - PPO RL-Kalman          : learned policy with Kalman-filtered state

    By pairing Kalman estimation with a hand-designed (non-RL) controller,
    this baseline quantifies how much of the RL-Kalman performance gain (or
    loss) comes from the estimation step vs. the learned control.

    Behavior:
        - When e_hat is available (enemy detected, Kalman estimate active):
          Move directly toward the Kalman-filtered enemy position e_hat.
        - When e_hat is None (enemy not yet detected):
          Escort the soldier (move toward soldier_pos).

    Attributes:
        eps: Small threshold for numerical stability in vector normalization.

    Example:
        >>> env = SoldierEnv(EnvConfig(use_kalman_tracking=True))
        >>> policy = KalmanGreedyInterceptPolicy()
        >>> obs, info = env.reset()
        >>> action = policy.act(obs, info)
        >>> obs, reward, done, truncated, info = env.step(action)
